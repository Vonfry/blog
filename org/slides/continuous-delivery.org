* What is Continuous Delivery
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
/Continuous Delivery/[fn:2] is the *ability* to get changes of all types including new *features*, configuration *changes*, bug *fixes* and *experiments* into PRODUCTION, or into the hands of users, *safely* and *quickly* in a *sustainable* way.
#+END_QUOTE
* What is Continuous Integration
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
/Continuous Integration/[fn:3] is a software development *practice* where members of a team *integrate* their work *frequently*, usually each person integrates at least daily - leading to multiple integrations per day. Each integration is *verified* by an *automated build* (including test) to *detect* integration *errors* as *quickly* as possible.
#+END_QUOTE
* Why Continuous Delivery
** Low risk releases

[[https://www.evernote.com/l/ABeIYFLHPiBG-5ExmehzW-_cH1GiX4jVXHYB/image.jpg]]

- release fast
- release often

** Faster time to market

- no manual regressions
- avoid the large amounts of re-work
** Higher quality
- discover regressions within minutes
- teams are freed to focus on higher level exploratory testing, usability testing, performance and security testing
- ensuring quality is built in to products and services from the beginning

** Better products

- shorten feedback cycle
- avoid features we build that deliver zero

** Happier teams

* Essentials[fn:4]
** Maintain a single-source repository

[[https://www.evernote.com/l/ABdzsWIdHuJOfZ2FjTGVWuABXkRMouqkX8AB/image.png]]

- no feature branches
- every commit on =origin/master= should be deployable
- feature toggles

** Make your build self-testing

- repeatable
- scalable
- maintainable

** Automate the build
[[./images/futurama_June_30__2016_at_0906PM.gif]]

- no manual steps
- each step till release should be automated

** Fix broken builds immediately

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Keep it green
#+END_QUOTE

** Keep the build fast

[[./images/futurama_June_29__2016_at_1154PM.gif]]

** Test in a clone of the production environment

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
It works on my machine
#+END_QUOTE

- same platform
- same lib versions
- replica data if possible
- dockerize everything if you can

** Make it easy for anyone to get the latest executable

** Automate deployment
