* TL;DR Why another Org Mode Blog Generator

** This is a *really* *really simple* blog generator
so you can focus on writting

only thing you need to do is adding =org= or =markdown= files into =org= folder and =git push=, no more =C-c C-e P f=
** ...and Travis-ci will do it's job
travis ci will take care of everything 
- =(org-publish-all)=
- =git push= to github pages
** You Don't need to know =Ruby= to build a Blog

** Github Favored Markdown support

** also disqus comment system
everthing you want to custom can be added to =html/postamble.html=
** RSS

** Site Search

* OK here is the Magic

* Configuration
there're few places you need to customize for you own blog

** Deploy Key
https://github.com/jcouyang/blog/blob/master/deploy.enc

this is my encrypted deploy key so you better generate your own.

here's how

*** =ssh-keygen=
 with name deploy or somthing you like, I named it deploy
*** =gem install travis=
*** =travis login=
*** =travis encrypt-file deploy --add=
this will generate encrypted version of =deploy= file.

Make sure not to add =deploy= to the git repository. only add =deploy.enc=

the option =--add= will add something like [[https://github.com/jcouyang/blog/blob/master/.travis.yml#L6][this]] to your =.travis.yml= file, which is the decrypt step running on travis ci, so make sure it's at least before =before_script= step
*** =cat deploy.pub | pbcopy=
*** open the github repo you wanna publish as github pages > Settings > Deploy keys
*** =PASTE=

** =config.el=
fill as you like

** Disqus, Google Analystics and Swiftype
